# Obesity-Level-Classification-Using-Lifestyle-and-Physical-Condition-Data
A machine learning classification project to predict obesity levels based on eating habits, physical activity, and demographic data from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia

This project focuses on predicting obesity levels based on lifestyle habits and physical attributes of individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, ranging in age from 14 to 61. The dataset, collected through a web-based survey, includes 2,111 records with 17 features, covering aspects such as eating habits, physical activity, and demographics.

ðŸ§  Problem Statement
The goal is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts an individual's obesity category. This classification task is based on the Body Mass Index (BMI) thresholds defined as:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5

Normal weight: 18.5 â‰¤ BMI < 24.9

Overweight: 25.0 â‰¤ BMI < 29.9

Obesity Type I: 30.0 â‰¤ BMI < 34.9

Obesity Type II: 35.0 â‰¤ BMI < 39.9

Obesity Type III: BMI â‰¥ 40.0
